# hots tools
This repository consists of a bunch of random tools for Heroes of the Storm. At this point the contents include:

* `masterleague.py`: a wrapper around some of the functionality of the Master League API which allows you to gather professional match data from Heroes of the Storm matches.

* `draft.py`: a simple RNN implementation that generates sequences that look like Heroes of the Storm drafts if trained on draft data.
